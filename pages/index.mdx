Hey, my name is Matt, and I'm an aspiring full-stack developer and fan of the outdoors. I enjoy working with Javascript, CSS, React, and Python, in crafting efficient front-end experiences.

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio.
